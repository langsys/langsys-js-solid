/**
 * Bench precondition — fail loudly when the upstream artifact is the wrong one.
 *
 * ## Why this test exists
 * `langsys-js-typescript@0.6.5` on the npm registry and `0.6.5` in the local
 * working copy are **different code under one version string**: the 838 surface
 * (write gating + content discovery) was added on top of the already-published
 * 0.6.5 without a version bump. So no version comparison — not `package.json`,
 * not `npm view`, not the lockfile — can tell the two apart.
 *
 * This repo is developed against the local copy via `npm link`. A plain
 * `npm ci` or `npm install` silently replaces that symlink with the registry
 * tarball, and the rest of this suite stays green while doing it: nothing else
 * here touches the 838 symbols. Green tests beside a red typecheck is the
 * signature of an unpublished dependency, and it is worth exactly one test to
 * turn that into a red build instead.
 *
 * Sharper here than in the sibling bindings: this package still declares
 * `langsys-js-typescript@^0.4.1`, a range that excludes 0.6.5 in **either** of
 * its forms. The release wave owns that floor (Reviewer, `838-intake-solid`),
 * so until it moves, the symlink is the only thing putting the 838 surface on
 * the bench and this test is the only thing that notices when it goes.
 *
 * ## What it asserts
 * The symbols are probed **by identity, never by version string**, against the
 * artifact Node actually resolves. `generateCustomId` is the positive control:
 * it exists in both the published and local builds, so if it is missing the
 * import itself is broken and the other failures are not evidence of absence.
 *
 * Deliberately loaded through `createRequire`, not a dynamic `import()`: that
 * reads the **built artifact Node resolves on disk**, bypassing Vite's module
 * graph. Vite will not transform a linked package living outside the project
 * root, and a bundler's view of the dependency is not what this test asserts
 * about.
 *
 * ## Retiring it
 * Delete this file once the core publishes a tag whose *tarball* answers this
 * probe (>=0.7.0), and `package.json` is bumped to it. Until then this is the
 * only check in the suite that can tell the two 0.6.5s apart.
